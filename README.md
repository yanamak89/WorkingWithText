## Task 6: Console Registration Program
Write a console program that allows the user to register with a "Username" consisting only of Latin alphabet characters and a password that consists of numbers and symbols.

### Solution 1: Console Application
- The program will prompt the user to enter a username and password.
- The username must consist only of Latin alphabet characters.
- The password must consist of numbers and symbols.
- If either validation fails, the program will notify the user and request new inputs.

### Solution 2: AvaloniaUI Solution
There is also an alternative solution using AvaloniaUI for a graphical user interface (GUI) implementation. The Avalonia version allows users to input the username and password through a GUI instead of a console. You can find the Avalonia-based registration app at the following link:
